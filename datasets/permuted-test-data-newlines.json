We've just been dating for two weeks now.\n6) A: This is all news to me. I didn't even know you were dating.\n7) B: Hi Laura, long time no see! What have you been up to lately?\n8) A: Hi Kevin!\n9) B: A step up in the big business world.\n10) A: Come on. This suspense is killing me.\n11) A: Well, congratulations! That's fantastic!\n12) B: I know. I can't help it. I just know she's the one.\n13) B: Thanks, I'm glad to hear you feel way.\n14) B: No, really, what have you been doing these past few weeks? The last time I saw you, you were looking for a new job.\n15) A: I wouldn't exaggerate, but I am pleased. I had been hoping to get a promotion for a while. So when it finally came through, I was relieved. Actually, that's why I was looking for a new job. I just didn't want to work there anymore if they weren't going to recognize my efforts.\n16) B: Much the same except I do have some big news.\n17) A: Well, that's not exactly true. I was thinking about changing jobs. Luckily, they offered me a new position in the accounting department.\n18) B: I am getting married.\n19) A: And you getting married?\n20) B: Right, sometimes you can do your best and it seems like the others don't know you exist. I hope the money's better.\n",

Did you have any questions about our bikes?\n6) A: If it's in good shape, probably at least 50% of its original value.\n7) A: Oh, yes, we can handle any repairs you may need.\n8) B: Yeah. Do you work on bicycles in addition to selling them?\n9) A: We could do that, but I wouldn't recommend it, because you would have to use your legs more to go the same distance. You'd be better off buying a bike that's the right size for you.\n10) A: OK.\n11) B: Terrific! If you're here tomorrow, I'll bring it in then.\n",

You see, our profit margin is very narrow. It simply can't stand such a big cut.\n4) B: So do we. Certainly it's a step forward on your side. But the gap is still too wide.\n5) B: I hate to disappoint you, Mr. Brown, but if that's the case, we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere. Do think it over, please. We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion.\n6) B: As I said before, your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid. We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap.\n7) A: The ball is in your court, Mrs.Wang. What price would you suggest?\n8) B: Not at all. Shall we meet again, say, on Friday morning?\n9) A: Just to comply, we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent. I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling.\n10) A: Good. Friday morning at 9.\n11) A: Well, I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction. Would you mind waiting a day or two, until I get a reply from the home office?\n",
