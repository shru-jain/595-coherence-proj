On the other hand, you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket. [SEP] [CLS] 3) B: We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also, in line with that goal, redo our image...

First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work. [SEP] [CLS] 2) A: I see.
